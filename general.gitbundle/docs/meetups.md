## 2016-11-10

[Roadmap for 2016 Q4](https://skypickercom.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PT/Django+roadmap+Q4+2016)

* Tasks will be described (mostly) by Michal through Gitlab "Issues".
* Set *Assignee* to each MR. Asignee is person responsible for MR.
* Set *Milestone* to each MR. There are already prepared Milestones according 
  our OKRs. Put task under "Other" milestone if it is not related to OKR.
* Mark approved MRs with label `process/approved`.
* 2-3 open MRs per person (so no more than 12 open MR in total).
* MR older than 14 days must be labeled with `importance/critical` and solved as 
  soon as possible.
* Developers should spend at least 6 hours (75%) of time on tasks directly 
  related to programming; rest of the day could be spend on communication and other "soft" 
  activities.
* Update continuosly [IDEAS](https://gitlab.skypicker.com/django-team/kiwibase/issues/128)
  issue with ideas around our work. Will be used for definition OKR for next Q.
* Write blogpost or prepare talk about "Django under the hood" conference.

Each team member write down 3 notes about last month: what was good, bad and what
we should improve in next month. Then everybody could mark 2 ideas. Results:

**Good**

* (1) Cafeteria. Despite the time, we made it! =)
* (1) Lukas go access to test + production servers
* ( ) That we finally decided on merge requests (like no more than 3 MR/person, ...)

**Bad**

* ( ) For me, long time away (travels, events) at once
* ( ) Too many fuckups
* ( ) Missing CI/CD

**Improve**

* (2) Communication about the tasks. More specifications
* (2) CI/CD
* ( ) Communication between departures that we cooperate with so that things like 
      "On hold" don't happen
