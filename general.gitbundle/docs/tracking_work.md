# Tracking work

Every team member track his work using [Toggl][1] application and follow this
rules:

* Put description of your current task into *Description* field, like *Tech
  leads call*, *PR #123*, *MR!22*, *GitLab migration*, etc.
* Select project you are working on, like *Kiwibase. Kiwi.com*, *Knowledgebase.
  Kiwi.com*. We use Toggl for teams, ask @michal.valousek for adding you to
  common Toggl workspace. **Beware, this is important step! If you forgot to
  select project, your work will not be tracked!**
* Mark your current task with tags, use at least one "main" tag (see below)

Example of already tracked tasks during my normal working day:

For marking issues use one of the following main tags:

* `feature`
* `other`
* `maintenance`
* `bug`
* `refactoring`
* `travel`

You could also use your own tags like `pr`, `communication`, but only that five
"main" tags will be reported and calculated in week report. Those other tags
could be used in future for some fine tuned statistics.

## What to track

Track any work related task -- programming, meeting, release, maintenance,
studying project related documentation, tec.

Do not track your personal activities like going to lunch, doctor appointments,
etc.
