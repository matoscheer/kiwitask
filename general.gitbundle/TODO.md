Contributing guide:

* name conventions for branches? (automaticaly generated branches from issues
  in gitlab are ugly, but functional)
* microapprovements on MR? who should check ticks?
* some excerpt from Nina's talk: http://www.slideshare.net/nnja/how-to-successfully-grow-a-code-review-culture
* git commit messages format according to Bence & Lasse suggestions, never break master
* "Kiwiflow" instead "Gitflow" (nearly same, but we don't have develop branch now)
* small MR
* who made code review

General:

* How we make releases (we must cooperate with HR girls, Payrolls to not break their work)
* Move testing blogposts here
* Convert this file into GitLab Issues
* Who is who
